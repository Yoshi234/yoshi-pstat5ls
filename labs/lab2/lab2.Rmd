# Simulations and Randomness R

We will explore how to use 

+ `set.seed()`
+ `simulate_chance_model()`
+ `sum()`

**Seeds**:

+ seeds determine a random sequence which is entirely predictible
if you know the seed itself. 

```{r}
set.seed(2573)
```

**Simulate Chance Model**

In order to install this package, we need to install the 'remotes'
package for GitHub-based package installation. First, run 

```r
install.packages("remotes")
install.packages("checkmate")
```

or in Conda

```
conda install r-remotes r-checkmate
```

Then, execute

```{r}
library(remotes)
install_github("STATS250SBI/stats250sbi")
```

Now, we can access the package as follows:

```{r}
library(stats250sbi)
```
