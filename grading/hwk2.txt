q5.1: 

Correct: 
Parameter: The proportion of new vehicles sold 
which were ZEVs in 2023 (current year)

H0: The proportion of vehicles sold which were ZEVs
in 2022 is the same as it was in 2023

p = 0.188

H1: The proportion of vehicles sold which were ZEVs
in 2023 is greater than it was in 2022

p > 0.188

q2.4:

a: yes - we can make a causal statement because the 
experimental units were randomly assigned to the 
two treatments which mitigates the effect of all 
other confounding variables which could have impacted
the outcome. 

b: No - we should not generalize to the population of 
adults because the participants (1) were volunteers and 
(2) were NOT randomly selected from the population of 
adults but rather from the population of OVERWEIGHT 
adults.

q2.2: 

blocking is a known source of variability that
researchers want to control for in an experiment. 

Correct: Yes - blocking is used here. Participants 
are grouped by sex and then randomly assigned to one 
of the two treatment groups. 


q2.1: 

Correct: 76 overweight adults (38 men / 38 women)
who volunteered to be part of the study - random assignment to 
treatment groups

This is an experimental study with causal implications because 
participants were randomly assigned to the treatments 
(placebo = control and chia seeds = treatment 1) - full credit
